## Usage

![screencap1](/assets/images/screencap1.png)

This is how the app looks like when it loads.

![screencap2](/assets/images/screencap2.png)

Each row consists of 3 columns: time area, task area, and the save button.
- Time area dispalys the current time.
- Task area is where the user adds the text
- Save button stores whatever the data to the localStorage

The grey rows are in the past. Red rows are current, while the green ones are in the future. All boxes are editable regardless of the time.
